I am a researcher in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). My research is characterised by a highly interdisciplinary perspective on NLP, focusing on the potential for broad societal impact. In 2022 I was awarded a Semper Ardens: Accelerate grant of 5 million DKK from the Carlsberg Foundation, enabling me to carry out fundamental research in this area. My most significant scientific contributions are in incorporating linguistic information in NLP methodology, including large language models (LLMs), and improving the state for low-resource languages in particular. My current efforts are on engaging this NLP research in real-world settings, including education (funded by a Villum Synergy grant of 3 million DKK) and the healthcare sector. I am a member of The Young Academy (Det Unge Akademi, DUA), under the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. I focus on delivering high-quality teaching with elements of interactivity and tying theory to practice. As a result, I was in 2021 electedby the students at our department as Teacher of the Year. I engage actively in making NLP research accessible to the public, and am sought out for my expertise for interviews and podcasts by broadcasters such as DR and TV2.
