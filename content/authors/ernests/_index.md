My academic interests lay in Machine Learning (ML), more specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), Image and Audio Processing. Throughout my studies I have worked on projects related to AI transparency and adversarial attacks, Question-Answering and Part-of-Speech tagging in NLP, image coloration and novel view synthesis in Computer Vision, as well as speech enhancement using diffusion-based generative models in Audio Processing. Primarily interested in factuality, low-resource constraints and explainable language modelling. Also, merging modalities in AI by creating systems that can learn from multiple sources of data, for example text and audio, or text and images. I am also interested in the ethical implications of AI and the role of AI in society.

Otherwise, I have worked for nearly 3 years in Fraunhofer IIS institute as part of an audio research team developing a proposal for the MPEG-I standard. My role was part of an internal audio evaluation team, more specifically planning and developing test content in XR (HTC Vive, HoloLens 1 and 2), conducting listening tests, development of a common audio evaluation platform used for the final tests of the standard and developing CI/CD pipelines with GitLab. Also, providing technical support and sharing my know-how to in-house students with their research projects and thesis.

For almost the past 2 years, parallel to my studies in Aalborg University, I have been also working as an Android app developer for a local startup. This has been an interesting change of environment from applied research to business and product development. My main contributions have been in maintaining and developing new features for the Android app in accordance to a project roadmap and guidance by product managers. The work helped me refine practices of asynchronous programming, working with REST API, software design patterns as well as communicating technical information with backend engineers in regards to any necessary API changes or queries regarding app behaviour. Besides app development, I had input on yearly roadmaps, performed analysis of user behaviour and app usage based on tracking data, refined our data and tracking practices, and communicated these insights to management and the rest of the team.
