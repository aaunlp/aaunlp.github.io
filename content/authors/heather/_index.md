I am a postdoc researcher specialized in Natural Language Processing (NLP). My primary research interest is in remedying vulnerabilities across NLP. My work includes improving methods for low-resource machine learning for low-resource languages (e.g., Creoles) and domains (e.g., Medicine), as well as addressing cyber-security vulnerabilities inherent to training and deploying public-facing models (e.g., embedding inversion attacks).
