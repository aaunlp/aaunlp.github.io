abstract: Creole languages are low-resource languages, often genetically related to languages like English, French, and Portuguese, due to their linguistic histories with colonialism (DeGraff, 2003). As such, Creoles stand to benefit greatly from both data-efficient methods and transfer-learning from high-resource languages. At the same time, it has been observed by Lent et al. (2022b) that machine translation (MT) is a highly desired language technology by speakers of many Creoles. To this end, recent works have contributed new datasets, allowing for the development and evaluation of MT systems for Creoles (Robinson et al., 2024; Lent et al. 2024). In this work, we explore the use of the limited monolingual and parallel data for Creoles using parameter-efficient adaptation methods. Specifically, we compare the performance of different adapter architectures over the set of available benchmarks. We find adapters a promising approach for Creoles because they are parameter-efficient and have been shown to leverage transfer learning between related languages (Faisal and Anastasopoulos, 2022). While we perform experiments across multiple Creoles, we present only on Haitian Creole in this extended abstract. For future work, we aim to explore the potentials for leveraging other high-resourced languages for parameter-efficient transfer learning.
